Q: I have a node.js express app, with a react.js client. I auth users with access tolken and refresh token, which is saved on the client. On the server I save refersh tokens in db. How exacltly should `logout` action do, both on client and on server? Should I request a valid access token to accept logout requests?

A:
To implement a logout functionality in your Node.js Express app with a React.js client, you need to consider both the client-side and server-side actions. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to effectively handle the logout process.
Client-Side Logout Implementation
Clear Local Tokens: When the user initiates a logout action, you should remove any stored tokens (both access and refresh tokens) from the client's local storage or cookies.
Logout Request: Send a request to the server to log out the user. This is typically done using an HTTP GET request to your logout endpoint.
Example using Axios:
javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const handleLogout = async () => {
    try {
        await axios.get('/api/logout'); // Adjust the endpoint as necessary
        localStorage.removeItem('accessToken');
        localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
        // Optionally redirect to login page or show a success message
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Logout failed:", error);
    }
};

Server-Side Logout Implementation
Validate Access Token: While it's not strictly necessary to validate the access token for a logout request, doing so can add an extra layer of security. If you choose to validate it, check if the token is valid before proceeding with logout.
Remove Refresh Token: On the server, when handling the logout request, you should remove the refresh token associated with the user from your database.
Clear Session: If you are using sessions, ensure that you destroy the user's session on logout.
Respond to Client: Send an appropriate response back to the client indicating whether the logout was successful.
Example Express.js route:
javascript
app.get('/api/logout', async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.user.id; // Assuming user ID is attached to req.user after authentication

    // Remove refresh token from database
    await TokenModel.deleteOne({ userId }); // Adjust based on your database schema

    // Optionally destroy session if using sessions
    req.session.destroy(err => {
        if (err) return res.status(500).send("Could not log out.");
        res.clearCookie('refreshToken'); // Clear any cookies if used
        return res.status(200).send("Logged out successfully.");
    });
});
