## Tutorials 

- [To-do Application using acme-server and React](https://docs.acme-server.com/tutorials/react-todos/)

## acme-server Cloud (SaaS)

Launch acme-server from [app.acme-server.com](http://app.acme-server.com/)

## Development Environment (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v16 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

### Getting Started With Local Development

acme-server is using a monorepo with multiple apps and libraries.

Follow these simple instructions to set up a local development environment.

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/marcolino/acme-server.git
  cd acme-server
  npm install
  ```

2. Run the [setup script](https://github.com/acme-server/acme-server/blob/master/scripts/setup.ts), which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages and ensuring your workspace is dev-ready.

  ```bash
  npm run setup:dev
  ```

3. Spin up all required infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka, etc.) using Docker Compose:

  ```bash
  # To be able to view logs
  npm run docker:dev

  # Or, if you prefer to run it at the background
  npm run docker:dev -- -d
  ```

4. Apply database migrations:

  ```bash
  npm run db:migrate:deploy
  ```

5. To start developing, run the `serve` target of the desired app:

  ```bash
  # This will serve the acme-server Server in development mode
  yarn start-dev 
  ```

+ **Please note that in order to be able to run the app's client properly, you need to `serve-dev` both the server and client.**

That's it, you are good to go! Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾

### Setting Up acme-server Manually

You can use a manual step-by-step approach to set up acme-server in a local development environment. To do so, you should follow the following instructions for **Setting Up acme-server Server**, and **Setting Up acme-server Client**.

#### Setting up [acme-server Server](https://github.com/acme-server/acme-server/blob/master/packages/acme-server-server/README.md)

acme-server Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a REST API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, and many more...

#### Setting Up [acme-server Client](https://github.com/acme-server/acme-server/blob/master/packages/acme-server-client/README.md)

acme-server Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy-to-drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, React Material Web Components, Formik, and more.
