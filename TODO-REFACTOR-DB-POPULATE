From ChatGPT:

To test your `populate` function using Mocha, there are a few things to consider. The current implementation of `populate` is asynchronous, but it does not use promises or async/await syntax, which makes testing more challenging. Also, the `populate` function does not currently return a promise or take a callback, which makes it hard to know when it has completed its operation.

To effectively test it with Mocha, you need to refactor your code to handle asynchronous behavior properly and allow Mocha to know when the `populate` function has finished executing.

### Step 1: Refactor the `populate` Function

Refactor the `populate` function to return a promise so that you can wait for it to complete. This will make testing easier and also make your code more maintainable. Here's how you can refactor it:

```javascript
const populate = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // First time populate static reference documents
    User.estimatedDocumentCount((err, count) => {
      if (err) {
        logger.error("Error estimating users documents count:", err);
        return reject(err); // reject the promise if there is an error
      }

      if (count === 0) { // roles is empty
        const savePromises = db.users.map(user => {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            new User(user).save(err => {
              if (err) {
                logger.error("Error saving user:", err);
                return reject(err);
              }
              logger.info(`added user ${user.name} to users collection`);
              resolve();
            });
          });
        });

        // Wait for all save operations to complete
        Promise.all(savePromises)
          .then(resolve)
          .catch(reject);
      } else {
        // If users collection is not empty, resolve immediately
        resolve();
      }
    });
  });
};
```

### Step 2: Update Your Mocha Test

With the refactored `populate` function that returns a promise, you can now test it using Mocha. Mocha supports returning a promise in a test case, which it will wait for before completing the test. Here is how you can write your test:

```javascript
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;
const db = require('../path-to-your-db-module');

describe("Database population", function() {
  it("should populate database if empty", function(done) {
    db.populate()
      .then(() => {
        // Verify the population (you might want to check if specific users are present)
        return User.estimatedDocumentCount();
      })
      .then(count => {
        expect(count).to.be.above(0); // Check that the collection is not empty
        done();
      })
      .catch(err => {
        done(err); // Pass error to done to fail the test
      });
  });
});
```

### Step 3: Additional Considerations

1. **Database Setup/Teardown:** Before running the test, you might want to clear the `User` collection to ensure it is empty. Similarly, after running the test, you may want to clean up to avoid side effects for other tests.
   
   ```javascript
   beforeEach(function(done) {
     User.deleteMany({}, done); // Clear the collection before each test
   });

   afterEach(function(done) {
     User.deleteMany({}, done); // Clear the collection after each test
   });
   ```

2. **Mocking the Database:** If you want to isolate the test from the actual database, you can use mocking libraries like `sinon` or `mongoose-mock` to mock the `User` model and database methods.

3. **Error Handling:** Ensure that all possible errors are properly caught and handled to avoid unhandled promise rejections.

### Summary

- Refactor the `populate` function to return a promise.
- Use Mocha's capability to handle promises in test cases by returning the promise.
- Consider database setup/teardown before and after tests.
- Properly handle asynchronous code to make tests more reliable and predictable.

This refactoring and testing approach will provide a reliable way to test your database population logic using Mocha.
