Q: 
If in my main test file I do:

before(async () => {
  
  console.log("BEFORE");
  await db.ensureMongooseConnection();

then db.ensureMongooseConnection is called BEFORE server completes main database connection:

BEFORE
Mongoose not connected, reconnecting...
  1) "before all" hook in "{root}"
INFO: 2025-02-12T10:01:58.232Z Database connected
populate (database acme_test)

So I think that in my test file, when I do:

const app = require("../../server");
and then
const agent = request(app);

I should someway wait for database to be connected, before proceeding...
Right ? If so, how to do it ?
  
  
  
A :
Yes, you are absolutely correct! The core issue is a race condition between your test setup and the initialization of your Express app, specifically the database connection.Your test is attempting to connect to the database * before * your`app` has finished establishing its own connection.

Here's how to solve this, with a breakdown of why each step is important:

**Solution: Ensure Database Connection Before Running Tests**

The best approach is to export a promise from your `server.js` (or wherever you initialize your database) that resolves *only after* the database connection is successfully established. Then, `await` that promise in your test setup.

**Step 1: Modify `server.js` to Export a "Database Ready" Promise**

```javascript
// server.js (or your main app file)
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const config = require('./config'); // Adjust path
const logger = require('./controllers/logger.controller');

let dbConnectionPromise; // Store the promise here

async function connectToDatabase() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(config.mongo.uri, config.mongo.options);
    logger.info("Database connected");
    console.log("Database connected");
  } catch (err) {
    logger.error("Database connection error:", err);
    console.error("Database connection error:", err);
    throw err; // Re-throw to prevent the app from starting with no DB connection
  }
}

dbConnectionPromise = connectToDatabase(); // Start the connection immediately

// Export the promise AND the app
module.exports = {
  app: require('./app'), // Assuming you have an app.js or similar
  dbConnectionReady: dbConnectionPromise,
};
```

Key Changes:

*   **`dbConnectionPromise`:**  A variable to hold the promise that represents the database connection.
*   **`connectToDatabase()` function:**  This encapsulates the connection logic.  It's now an `async` function.
*   **`dbConnectionPromise = connectToDatabase()`:**  Crucially, we call `connectToDatabase()` immediately, which *starts* the database connection process.  We then store the *promise* returned by `connectToDatabase()`.
*   **Export `dbConnectionReady`:** We export the `dbConnectionPromise` so our tests can wait for it to resolve.
*   **Re-throwing errors:** The `connectToDatabase()` function now re-throws the error. This makes sure that the app doesn't start if the database connection fails.

**Step 2: Modify Your Test Setup**

```javascript
// Your test file (e.g., test/your-test.js)
const { app, dbConnectionReady } = require('../../server'); // Adjust path
const request = require('supertest');
const db = require('../utils/db'); // Assuming you have a db utility file
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const agent = request(app);

before(async () => {
  console.log("BEFORE: Waiting for database connection...");
  await dbConnectionReady; // Wait for the database to connect
  console.log("BEFORE: Database connected, proceeding with tests...");

  // Now it's safe to populate the database
  console.log("Populating database...");
  await db.populate();
  console.log("Database populated.");
});

// Your tests...
```

Key Changes:

*   **Import `dbConnectionReady`:**  Import the promise from your `server.js`.
*   **`await dbConnectionReady`:**  *This is the most important line*.  This tells your test setup to *pause* execution until the database connection is successfully established. Only then will the `before` hook continue.
*   **Logging:**  The `console.log` statements help you track the order of execution.
*   **`db.populate()` after awaiting the connection** Call to populate only after the database is connected.

**Why This Works**

1.  **Guaranteed Order:**  The `await dbConnectionReady;` line ensures that the test setup *waits* for the database to connect before proceeding.
2.  **Proper Context:** The `app` is now fully initialized *after* the database connection is established. This prevents race conditions.
3.  **Clear Error Handling:** If the database connection fails in `server.js`, the re-thrown error will prevent the app from starting, and your tests will also fail (as they should).

**Additional Considerations**

*   **Test Database Configuration:** Double-check that your `config.mongo.test.uri` is correctly configured for your test environment.
*   **Mongoose Connection Options:** Review your Mongoose connection options (e.g., `config.mongo.options`) to ensure they are appropriate for your test environment. Consider increasing `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` as mentioned earlier.
*   **Error Handling in Tests:** Add `try...catch` blocks around your `before` hook to handle any errors that might occur during the database connection or population process.

**Complete Example (`server.js`)**

```javascript
// server.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const express = require('express');
const config = require('./config'); // Adjust path
const logger = require('./controllers/logger.controller');

let dbConnectionPromise;

async function connectToDatabase() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(config.mongo.uri, config.mongo.options);
    logger.info("Database connected");
    console.log("Database connected");
  } catch (err) {
    logger.error("Database connection error:", err);
    console.error("Database connection error:", err);
    throw err;
  }
}

dbConnectionPromise = connectToDatabase();

const app = express();
// ... your Express app configuration ...

// Optionally, start the server only after the database is connected:
dbConnectionPromise.then(() => {
  app.listen(config.port, () => {
    logger.info(`Server listening on port ${config.port}`);
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${config.port}`);
  });
}).catch(err => {
  logger.error("Failed to start server:", err);
  console.error("Failed to start server:", err);
});

module.exports = {
  app: app,
  dbConnectionReady: dbConnectionPromise,
};
```

By implementing this solution, you should eliminate the race condition and ensure that your tests always run with a properly connected database. Remember to thoroughly test your changes to confirm that everything is working as expected.
