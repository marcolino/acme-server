Q: I use fly.io to publish my web app, free tier.

This is my Dockerfile: ...

For a staging environment, I'd like to publish on a different app name, so that I can have a staging server, exactly built as for the production env, but on a staging url (and of course I'd change Mongo database connection info...).
Is it possible? and - if it is - how?

A: Yes, it's absolutely possible to deploy your app to a different environment (like staging) on Fly.io using a different app name. This allows you to have a separate instance of your app with its own URL and configuration, such as a different MongoDB connection string. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Deploy to a Staging Environment on Fly.io

1. **Create a New App for Staging**:
   Use the `flyctl` CLI to create a new app for your staging environment. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   flyctl apps create --name your-staging-app-name
   ```
   Replace `your-staging-app-name` with a unique name for your staging app.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   You can configure environment variables specific to your staging environment using the `flyctl` CLI. For example:
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set MONGO_URL=your-staging-mongo-url NODE_ENV=staging
   ```
   This ensures your staging app uses the correct database and environment settings.

3. **Deploy the App**:
   Deploy your app to the staging environment using the `flyctl deploy` command. Make sure you're in the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   flyctl deploy --app your-staging-app-name
   ```
   This will build and deploy your app using the Dockerfile you provided.

4. **Verify the Deployment**:
   Once the deployment is complete, you can check the status of your app:
   ```bash
   flyctl status --app your-staging-app-name
   ```
   You can also open the app in your browser:
   ```bash
   flyctl open --app your-staging-app-name
   ```

5. **Automate Deployments (Optional)**:
   If you want to automate deployments to staging, you can use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions. For example, you can create a workflow that deploys to staging when you push to a specific branch (e.g., `staging`).

### Example Workflow for Staging and Production

- **Production**:
  - App name: `your-production-app-name`
  - Deploy with:
    ```bash
    flyctl deploy --app your-production-app-name
    ```

- **Staging**:
  - App name: `your-staging-app-name`
  - Deploy with:
    ```bash
    flyctl deploy --app your-staging-app-name
    ```

---

### Notes

- **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
  Use environment variables (via `flyctl secrets set`) to manage configuration differences between staging and production, such as database URLs, API keys, etc.

- **Dockerfile**:
  Your Dockerfile doesn't need to change for staging. The same Dockerfile can be used for both environments.

- **Scaling**:
  If you're on the free tier, be mindful of resource usage. You can scale your staging app down when not in use to save resources:
  ```bash
  flyctl scale count 0 --app your-staging-app-name
  ```
  Scale it back up when needed:
  ```bash
  flyctl scale count 1 --app your-staging-app-name
  ```

---

By following these steps, you can easily maintain separate staging and production environments on Fly.io.
